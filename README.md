For my thesis I chose to develop a mobile application for ordering a taxi.
With a user friendly interface, people will easily be able to register and request a taxi from their location.
The application will search for the closest taxi driver that is available.
Moreover, the user is also able to register as a taxi driver and he can pick up the requests of the users registered as clients that are within his area.
I named the application Fritaxi, representing a merge of the words ‘friend’ and ‘taxi’, a friend that will come to pick you up as soon as possible.

Main Technologies used:
- Android Studio and Java programming language
- Google Maps API and relevant functions
- Petri Nets Representation
